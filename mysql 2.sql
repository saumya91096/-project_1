-- Recommendations

-- Drop-off Points:= High drop-offs at Checkout suggest improving the checkout process (e.g., simplifying forms, offering more payment options).
-- Successful Conversions:= Homepage clicks often lead to purchasesâ€”enhance homepage Actions and product visibility.
-- Reviews:= Focus on improving low-rated products  and promote high-rated ones 
-- Retention:= Low retention rates indicate a need for loyalty programs or follow-up campaigns.
-- Regional Performance:= Tailor marketing to promote top products in specific regions.
